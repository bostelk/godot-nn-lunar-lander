# godot-nn-lunar-lander
A Godot example project to solve [Lunar Landar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Lander_(1979_video_game)) an Atari game made in 1979. A simple nerual net was trained using the [Lunar Lander Gym](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/box2d/lunar_lander/) to control the lander.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate a neural network running in a Godot compute shader. The shaders are written in [Slang](https://shader-slang.org) to improve portability.
